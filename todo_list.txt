- extract the part with sorting the grid-item-list by row/col into a separate function
- prevent that grids embedded in grids will trigger also the "reduce as griD2-function (seen with the second VBox-Layout)
- clear the output and send it to the general output; just use qDebug for the runtime-messages .... so usage
./CLexer 'input' > output
is doable
- add some simple test-examples where the result is easily checkable: like simple grid (done); grid in grid, grid in other layout, ...
